# My Shell

My Shell is a simple Unix-like shell implemented in C, designed for practicing system programming skills. This project showcases your ability to work with processes, forks, and system calls while providing users with a basic command-line interface.

## Features

- **Basic Shell Operations**: My Shell allows users to enter shell commands just like a standard Unix shell.

- **Command Execution**: It creates child processes to execute the entered shell commands and waits for them to complete.

- **Redirection**: Users can redirect standard input and output using `<` and `>` respectively.

- **Pipes**: My Shell supports pipes (`|`) to enable users to chain multiple commands together, similar to how they work in Unix shells.
